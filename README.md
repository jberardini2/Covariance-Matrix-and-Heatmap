# Covariance-Matrix-and-Heatmap
Creating a covariance matrix and heatmap to evaluate MLB standings data.

I gathered data from MLB standings for 2022. I selected the best and the worst teams and recorded the following for 12 teams. 
The object is to determine which stats correlate with each other by evaluating the covariance matrix.  

RD = Run Differntial

AW = Number of wins on the road

W500 = Number of wins against over 500 teams

WVL = Wins versus lefties

W1RUN = Number of wins in 1 run games

Total1RUN = Total number of 1 run games

WID = Number of wins in division
